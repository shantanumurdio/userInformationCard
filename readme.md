- `styles.css`: The CSS file for styling the page.

- `script.js`: The JavaScript file that handles storing and displaying user information using local storage.

## Styling

The page is styled using CSS to make it visually appealing and user-friendly. The styling includes a container with a drop shadow, a centered layout, and a clean design.
